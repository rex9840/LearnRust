[comment]:# (the notes are refrences from tour with rust and my learning companion for the rust langauge ) 



*Rust as a language aims to solve many of these common challenges in systems programming:* 

- Unintentional modification of resources
- Forgetting to deconstruct resources
- Resources accidentally being deconstructed twice
- Using resources after they have been deconstructed
- Data races caused by writing to resources while others are reading from resources
- Seeing clearly areas of the code where the compiler canâ€™t make guarantees

**One of the imp concepts of rust are**
- ownership 
- borrowing 
- lifetimes
